Software engineer with a background in quantum computing, electrical engineering, and physics. Spent a PhD researching reconfigurable photonic systems, first for quantum computing and then for networking. 

These days, I work for Meta/Facebook, helping to design and optimize their machine learning systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, reading, nature photography, and hiking with my partner and my dog Tofu.
